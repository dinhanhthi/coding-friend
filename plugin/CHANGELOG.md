# Changelog (Plugin)

> CLI changelog: `[cli/CHANGELOG.md](../cli/CHANGELOG.md)`

## v0.35.2 (2026-06-07)

- Make the `/cf-plan` human overview doc **opt-in** — it is now **off by default** (it costs extra tokens); enable per-run with `--gui` (alias `--human`). `--gui` overrides fast mode; precedence is inline > `--gui` > fast > config [#df7fa7e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/df7fa7e)
- `/cf-review` with Codex now auto-selects the review scope to cover committed changes [#9138857](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/9138857)
- Add a session ID component to the statusline [#ae38cb4](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/ae38cb4)
- Fix `/cf-plan` Mermaid node label text so it stays readable on bright fills [#ff153df](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/ff153df)

## v0.35.1 (2026-06-06)

- Improve the `/cf-plan` human overview — richer, more readable `overview.html` layout and add a `slug` field to the plan README frontmatter [#ffe8444](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/ffe8444)

## v0.35.0 (2026-06-06)

- Add a human-readable overview doc to `/cf-plan` — alongside the agent plan it generates `overview.html` (default) or `overview.md` (set via the `guiPlanFormat` config), a concise, decision-focused summary with Mermaid diagrams (problem/intent, solution, key decisions). Generated point-in-time by `cf-writer-deep` from a sanitized template. New `--no-gui` (alias `--no-human`) flag and the `disableGUIPlan` config disable it; **fast mode and `--inline` skip it automatically**. Every plan is now saved as a **subfolder** (`<slug>/`) with `README.md` as the entry point — single-phase plans included; `--resume` stays backward-compatible with legacy single-file plans. `cf-reviewer-plan` ignores `overview.*` so plan-alignment review still targets the agent plan [#623a2f1](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/623a2f1)
- Add `--codex` as an alias for `/cf-review --with-codex` [#58e6e1d](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/58e6e1d)
- Fix the auto-approve hook — anchor `/dev/null` redirects and block newline separators [#93632dc](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/93632dc)

## v0.34.4 (2026-06-03)

- Improve `/cf-commit` — cap body at 4 bullets (≤ 72 chars each), prefer subject-only for small changes, require concise bullet list over prose [#3cf82c9](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/3cf82c9)
- Improve `/cf-plan --fast` — single-phase plans stay in chat (no plan file written); multi-phase and `--auto` still write to disk; drop 8-task threshold and collapse Small plan template to 1 phase [#3cd4de2](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/3cd4de2)

## v0.34.3 (2026-05-29)

- Honor the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var in plugin hooks and the session skill — `session-init.sh` checks the global settings file, `statusline.sh` reads credentials + installed-plugins (and prefers the config-dir credentials over the Keychain when set), and `cf-session`'s `detect-session.sh` resolves the projects directory all under the overridden config directory instead of `~/.claude`. Adds a shared `cf_claude_dir()` resolver to `plugin/lib/cf-paths.sh` (trims whitespace, tilde-expands a leading `~`, else verbatim; falls back to `~/.claude`) that mirrors the CLI resolver so every surface resolves the variable identically; the HOME-level `~/.claude.json` is intentionally not relocated [#cf5007a](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/cf5007a)
- Add `--add-tests` to `/cf-plan` usage docs and alias `--tdd` to it [#d37f222](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/d37f222)

## v0.34.2 (2026-05-28)

- Add `--with-codex` flag to `/cf-review` — runs a Codex second-opinion review (`codex review --uncommitted`) as a background process concurrently with Claude's own multi-agent review, then merges both through the reducer (Codex `[P2]`→⚠️, `[P3]`→💡, anything else incl. `[P1]`/`[P0]`→🚨 so a top severity never fails silent). New scripts `run-codex-review.sh` (invoke + graceful fallback when Codex is unavailable on PATH or errors) and `normalize-codex-review.sh` (never drops unparseable output — folds it into Summary). Config-gated by `review.withCodex` so auto-invoked reviews from `/cf-plan`, `/cf-fix`, `/cf-optimize` can opt in without passing the flag; falls back to a Claude-only review with a warning if Codex is unavailable [#ba32860](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/ba32860)

## v0.34.1 (2026-05-21)

- Add `--inline` (alias `--no-file`) flag to `/cf-plan` — skips the on-disk plan file; the plan is presented in chat and progress is tracked via `TaskCreate`. Incompatible with `--auto` and `--resume` (both rely on a persistent plan file). Also adds `--quick` as a friendlier alias for `--fast`; both flags are normalized to their canonical form in Step 0.5 [#a200ee7](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/a200ee7)
- Annotate every skill and agent with a CLI Requirement callout (NONE or OPTIONAL) immediately below the H1, linking to `docs/cli-requirements.md` so plugin-only users can see at a glance whether a skill needs `coding-friend-cli`. `cf-explorer` is OPTIONAL due to `memory_search` in its Step 0 cache; all other agents are NONE [#5c36b4b](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/5c36b4b)
- Add "CLI Requirements" section to `plugin/README.md` with the 3-tier table and quick install/fallback instructions, positioned right after the intro paragraph [#e603e9d](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/e603e9d)

## v0.34.0 (2026-05-16)

- Add `--auto` flag to `/cf-plan` and `cf-tdd` — opt-in autopilot mode that runs phases/implementation autonomously (tasks → `/cf-review` → fix Critical/Important findings → git commit → next phase) with embedded `AUTOPILOT` contract that survives context eviction; `auto:true` frontmatter gates resume behavior; modes are orthogonal (combines with fast/hard/normal in `cf-plan`, with Direct/TDD in `cf-tdd`); explicit opt-in only — never auto-detected [#147add3](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/147add3)

## v0.33.5 (2026-05-14)

- Auto-approve `pnpm prettier` and `pnpm exec prettier` — pure formatter invocations are safe to run silently like `npx prettier`; other `pnpm` subcommands still route to ASK because they execute package scripts/plugins [#f93f3207](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f93f3207)
- Refine `/cf-plan` big-plan phase sync rules — explicitly cover phase-start (`🔄 IN PROGRESS`), phase-fail (`❌ FAILED`), and plan-done states in `README.md`; require every flip to be applied immediately via its own Edit call and serialize concurrent edits from parallel phases to avoid losing updates to the shared table [#f93f3207](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f93f3207)

## v0.33.4 (2026-05-05)

- Mark `/cf-session` skill as beta — flag the cross-machine session save/load flow as beta in skill frontmatter, README skills table, and regenerated token counts to surface beta status in website badges while detection/resume reliability is hardened [#93b9bf3](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/93b9bf3)

## v0.33.3 (2026-05-05)

- Fix `load-custom-guide.sh` — resolve custom guide path relative to git project root instead of CWD; prevents silent failures when a skill is invoked from a subdirectory (e.g. after `cd cli/`) [#7f9d14d](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/7f9d14d)

## v0.33.2 (2026-05-05)

- Extend YYYY-MM-DD date-prefix convention to all generated docs — `cf-plan`, `cf-fix`, `cf-remember`, `cf-ask`, `cf-scan`, `cf-teach`, `cf-sys-debug`, `cf-session`, `cf-review-out`, `cf-review-in` now produce date-prefixed filenames; fixes `cf-fix` task-id format inconsistency, adds missing `/cf-warm` to `cf-help`, and improves `cf-ask` numbered list formatting [#039867d](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/039867d)

## v0.33.1 (2026-05-03)

- Add `created`, `updated`, and `state` (beta) metadata fields to skill and agent frontmatter — build script extracts these into `token-counts.json`; website shows status badges (Beta/New/Updated) in sidebar and tables [#e67f6ea](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/e67f6ea)

## v0.33.0 (2026-05-03)

- Add worktree support — `cf-paths.sh` resolves `MAIN_REPO_ROOT`, `CF_DOCS_ROOT`, and skill/hook paths correctly when working in git worktrees; `session-init`, `memory-capture`, `privacy-block`, and skills (`cf-ask`, `cf-fix`, `cf-plan`, `cf-remember`, `cf-scan`, `cf-session`, `cf-sys-debug`, `cf-warm`) updated to use worktree-aware path resolution [#35e4e0c](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/35e4e0c)
- Add `--resume` flag to `/cf-plan` — resume interrupted plans by passing the plan file path; adds checkpoint protocol with status icons (⬜→🔄→✅/❌) to track task progress; plan file becomes both specification and execution state tracker; big-plan phase sync cascades task✅→phase✅→README✅→plan✅ DONE [#3432a05](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/3432a05)
- Make TDD opt-in — default behavior is now direct implementation without new tests; TDD enabled via `--add-tests` flag or `tdd: true` in config; updates `cf-tdd`, `cf-fix`, `cf-optimize`, `cf-plan`, `cf-review-in`, and `cf-implementer` agent prompt accordingly [#54f384e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/54f384e)
- Make `cf-learn` global-only — learn docs always go to `~/.coding-friend/learn/`; removes per-project `docs/learn/` support; `cf-learn` SKILL.md updated with `learn.disabled` flag, path validation, and conflict detection [#5988a0a](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/5988a0a)
- Improve `cf-design`: rename `DESIGN_PATTERNS.md` to `DESIGN.md`, save to `docs/` (not `docs/memory/`), and confirm after saving in Scan Mode instead of before [#6d52e8f](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/6d52e8f) [#26b3eed](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/26b3eed)
- Fix `auto-approve`: allow `||` chains when all clauses are safe — `cmd1 || cmd2` now auto-approves when each clause passes the existing safety rules [#6c7de58](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/6c7de58)
- Fix `auto-approve`: add `pnpm` and its subcommands (`test`, `run`, `exec`, `install`, `add`, `remove`, `publish`) to `BASH_ASK_PREFIXES` — prevents `pnpm` commands from falling through to LLM classification [#c104480](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/c104480)

## v0.32.0 (2026-04-30)

- Add `/cf-design` skill — UI design workflow with three modes: scan existing UI patterns into `DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`, design new UI from a natural-language description while respecting patterns, and modify specific UI elements with automatic consistency enforcement; includes reference guides for design styles and principles [#d4550b25](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/d4550b25)
- Remove `/cf-review-codex` skill and `cf-reviewer-codex` agent — Codex integration is no longer part of the review pipeline; `cf-reviewer` now dispatches the standard 5 specialist agents only [#6504b88f](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/6504b88f)

## v0.31.0 (2026-04-29)

- Improve `cf-remember`: add four concrete auto-trigger signals — non-obvious bug fixes (post `cf-fix`/`cf-sys-debug` with root cause or multiple failed attempts), explicit architecture decisions ("we chose X over Y"), new project-wide conventions established during implementation, and substantial sessions ending with undocumented gotchas; register `cf-remember` as an auto-invoked skill in `cf-help` [#dfdd159](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/dfdd159)

## v0.30.0 (2026-04-29)

- Add `/cf-review-codex` skill — dispatches code review jobs to Codex (GPT) via the `codex:codex-rescue` plugin; mirrors `/cf-review` workflow with Codex-specific routing, effort knob, and config-layered `codex.enabled`/`codex.modes`/`codex.effort` settings [#099105b](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/099105b)
- Fix `cf-reviewer`: extract Codex availability check into `plugin/skills/cf-review/scripts/check-codex.sh` — resolves silent Codex skip during `/cf-review` when `config.codex.enabled` was `true`; script now prints `KEY=value` lines readable across Bash tool invocations; hardens `jq` config parsing to distinguish `false` from absent keys [#f000115](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f000115)
- Improve `cf-sys-debug` description with concrete auto-invoke trigger signals (recurring bugs, flaky/race conditions, regressions, CI-only failures) and explicit boundary with `cf-fix` [#65db098](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/65db098)

## v0.29.1 (2026-04-29)

- Fix `auto-approve`: allow `xargs` with safe read-only subcommands (`grep`, `rg`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, `ls`, `cat`, `stat`, `diff`, `echo`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, `tr`, `jq`, `file`) — `xargs` with destructive subcommands (`rm`, `sh`, `bash`, `curl`, `find`) still requires confirmation [#f861c1e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f861c1e)
- Fix `auto-approve`: allow `rm` targeting project files in compound commands (`rm docs/f.json && echo done` auto-approves when rm path is inside the project directory) [#f861c1e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f861c1e)
- Fix `cf-reviewer` and `cf-reviewer-codex` agent prompts to reflect correct heading structure and review format [#f861c1e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f861c1e)

## v0.29.0 (2026-04-28)

- Add Codex cross-engine review to `/cf-review` (opt-in) — when `codex.enabled = true` in config and the `codex` CLI is installed, `cf-reviewer` dispatches a 6th parallel specialist via `codex:codex-rescue`; cross-engine agreement (Claude + Codex flagging the same `file:line`) bumps severity one tier in the reducer [auto-approve + config]
- Add `codex` config block to `.coding-friend/config.json` schema: `enabled` (boolean), `modes` (array of QUICK/STANDARD/DEEP), `effort` (minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh) — validated with Zod, deep-merged with defaults, typo suggestions for unknown keys including nested fields
- Improve `auto-approve`: allow `xargs` with safe read-only subcommands (grep, rg, wc, head, tail, ls, cat, stat, diff, echo, sort, uniq, cut, tr, jq, file) — xargs with destructive subcommands (rm, sh, bash, curl, find) still require confirmation
- Improve `auto-approve`: allow `rm` targeting project files in compound commands (`rm docs/f.json && echo done` auto-approves when rm path is inside the project directory)

## v0.28.1 (2026-04-27)

- Improve `auto-approve`: support semicolon-separated command chains — each `;`-separated clause is now evaluated independently (same as `&&` chains), allowing commands like `grep ... | head; echo "---"; grep ...` to auto-approve when all segments are safe [#f208e3d](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f208e3d)
- Improve `auto-approve`: allow `2>/dev/null` stderr suppression in compound commands — `find ... 2>/dev/null && find ... | head` now auto-approves without confirmation [#f208e3d](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f208e3d)
- Improve `cf-ask`: add Mermaid flow diagram for lifecycle/flow questions — architecture questions that describe a process or sequence now include a visual diagram alongside the prose explanation [#480f652](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/480f652)

## v0.28.0 (2026-04-24)

- Add modes (Deep Research / Quick Reference / Write to Understand), Digest phase with triangulation filter, Refine step (strip AI writing patterns), Gotchas table, and Specification Writing Mode to `cf-research` — research now targets primary sources, filters contradictions, and enforces a linear self-review gate before presenting results [#670b678](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/670b678)
- Add `cf-research` templates: Contradictions section and Quick Reference Notes template [#670b678](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/670b678)
- Add attack angles brainstorm, official solution check, no-placeholders rule, and not-building scope guard to `cf-plan` [#098cd0c](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/098cd0c)
- Improve `cf-fix` and `cf-sys-debug` with cognitive guardrails: rationalization watch tables, progress signals, bisect mode, structured output formats, and regression guard — debugging now follows evidence, not intuition [#4b768a5](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/4b768a5)

## v0.27 (2026-04-23)

- Add chunked plan support to `cf-plan`: large plans (8+ tasks or 3+ phases) are now split into a subfolder with `README.md` + per-phase chunk files; small plans remain as a single file — includes progress tracking table (TODO/IN PROGRESS/DONE icons) in all plan files [#6fc506e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/6fc506e) [#bfa17d6](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/bfa17d6)
- Fix `auto-approve` hook: allow CF plugin scripts (`.claude-plugin/`, `.claude/`) in compound `&&`/`;` commands with safe redirects (`>`, `>>`) — prevents false classifier hits when hook scripts write to log files [#e8e96e4](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/e8e96e4)

## v0.26 (2026-04-18)

- Expand `auto-approve` allow list with commonly used read-only commands: `cd`, `tr`, `ps`, `env`, `printenv`, `npm --version`/`-v`/`list`/`ls`, `rustc --version`/`-V`, `rustup show`/`--version`, `go version`, `git shortlog`, `git worktree list`, `git config --list`/`-l` — these frequently appear as segments in compound commands and were previously sent to the LLM classifier or prompted [#40fe1ff](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/40fe1ff)

## v0.25 (2026-04-17)

- Add `autoApproveIgnore` config — specify Bash command prefixes the `auto-approve` hook should skip classifying, deferring to Claude Code's native `permissions.allow` patterns (DENY rules still enforced) [#6621b61](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/6621b61)
- Downgrade `cf-implementer` agent from Opus to Sonnet — implementation is a structured, well-defined task; Opus is reserved for planning and complex reviews [#6f3bed3](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/6f3bed3)
- Fix inconsistent heading hierarchy in skill workflow sections — all skills now use `## Workflow` + `### Step N:` pattern consistently (`cf-help`, `cf-learn`, `cf-teach`, `cf-review`, `cf-review-in`, `cf-review-out`) [#71a01dc](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/71a01dc)
- Fix `auto-approve` hook to allow `rm` commands when all targets resolve within the project directory — previously blocked even project-scoped paths, requiring manual approvals for temp file cleanup [#bfd6a9c](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/bfd6a9c)
- Add `mkdir` to the `auto-approve` hook default allow list — safe and idempotent; no longer requires manual approval when creating context/docs directories [#f5f9b59](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/f5f9b59)
- Fix `/cf-review` skill running in a forked subagent — activation signal now shows immediately and the review report correctly uses the 🚨/⚠️/💡/📋 format instead of the layer-based structure [#51320e4](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/51320e4)
- Fix `auto-approve` LLM classifier timeout increased from 30s to 45s — reduces transient "LLM classification unavailable" fallbacks on slow networks or during cold starts [#4b24c8e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/4b24c8e)
- Document `autoApprove`, `autoApproveAllowExtra`, `autoApproveIgnore` config keys and `CF_AUTO_APPROVE_*` env vars in `docs/config-schema.md` [#4b24c8e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/4b24c8e)
- Fix `auto-approve` hook: implement quote-aware tokenization so shell metacharacters inside quoted strings (e.g. `grep "foo|bar"`, `grep "=>"`) are no longer mistaken for real operators — prevents false positives that triggered unnecessary confirmation prompts [#c83a1fc](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/c83a1fc)
- Fix `auto-approve` hook: `&&` chains are now auto-approved when all segments match the allow list — e.g. `git status && git log` no longer triggers the LLM classifier; single `&` (background operator) correctly blocked to prevent bypass [#2aa65ed](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/2aa65ed)
- Fix `cf-review`: remove redundant built-in security-review step that generated a separate non-formatted output, breaking the unified 🚨/⚠️/💡/📋 report [#ec565f7](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/ec565f7)
- Skills now show a 2-line memory save summary in confirm steps: the markdown file path and the MCP database indexing status (success or unavailable) — affects `cf-ask`, `cf-remember`, `cf-fix`, `cf-scan`, `cf-warm`, `cf-sys-debug` [#66318a5](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/66318a5)

## v0.24 (2026-04-06)

- Add per-account alias support to statusline — users can assign custom display names for each login account via `cf statusline`, `cf config`, or `cf init`; aliases are stored as an email-keyed map in `statusline.accountAliases` and replace the default name/email display [#126c11c](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/126c11c)
- Auto-approve `cargo fmt` as a safe formatter in the `auto-approve` hook [#1b79b39](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/1b79b39)

## v0.23 (2026-04-06)

- Move test runners and build tools (`npm test`, `npm run`, `npx jest`, `npx vitest`, `npx tsx`, `npx eslint`) from auto-approve allow list to ask list — these execute arbitrary code from repo files and could be exploited via prompt injection [#16c51cc](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/16c51cc)
- Add Cargo support to `auto-approve` hook — read-only subcommands (`cargo --version`, `cargo tree`, `cargo metadata`, `cargo search`, `cargo help`) auto-approve; all others (`cargo check`, `cargo build`, `cargo test`, etc.) require confirmation due to `build.rs` and proc-macro execution [#16c51cc](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/16c51cc)
- Add `autoApproveAllowExtra` config field — users can extend the auto-approve allow list per-project in `.coding-friend/config.json` to reduce prompts in trusted repos (DENY patterns and safety checks still apply) [#16c51cc](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/16c51cc)

## v0.22 (2026-04-05)

- Refactor `/cf-review` into multi-agent orchestrator that dispatches 5 specialist agents (`cf-reviewer-plan`, `cf-reviewer-security`, `cf-reviewer-quality`, `cf-reviewer-tests`, `cf-reviewer-rules`) in parallel and merges results via `cf-reviewer-reducer` [#e9c1d22](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/e9c1d22)
- Add structured context handoff and auto-retry for `cf-implementer` agent (context files, result signals, retry on failure) [#1d58b79](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/1d58b79)
- Add parallel execution for `cf-plan` task phases with agent-tracker locking fix [#8643c9c](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/8643c9c)
- Add task/agent tracking and LLM decision caching hooks, rename `dev-rules-reminder` → `rules-reminder` [#2d6c789](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/2d6c789) [#777d172](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/777d172)
- Phase 6 skills UX improvements — activation signals, TDD escapes, `/cf-ship` dry-run flag, `/cf-optimize` profiling, `/cf-commit` review check, `cf guide` CLI [#d68bfa0](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/d68bfa0)
- Fix `auto-approve` hook security issues — `stripStderrRedirect` bypass and deduplication [#6b0e90e](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/6b0e90e)
- Fix `/cf-review-out` and `/cf-review` to guide external agents to use embedded diff only [#7b673f6](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/7b673f6)
- Fix skill frontmatter to use `allowed-tools` instead of `tools` [#81ed469](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/81ed469)
- Use actual emojis instead of escape codes in skill output [#c743ebb](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/c743ebb)
- Refactor statusline to move model to first line and dedicate a row to account info [#a93e975](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/a93e975)
- Add troubleshooting reference and enhance auto-approve documentation [#5871858](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/5871858)

## v0.21 (2026-04-01)

- Add `/cf-warm` skill — catch up after absence by summarizing git history for a specific user, with dry-run safety, topic clustering, and memory indexing [#a507a96](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/coding-friend/commit/a507a96)
