## Overview

`cf dev` lets you seamlessly switch between the remote marketplace plugin and a local source copy. This is essential when developing or testing changes to the Coding Friend plugin itself.

## Usage

```bash
cf dev on [path]    # Switch to local plugin source
cf dev off          # Switch back to remote marketplace
cf dev status       # Show current dev mode
cf dev sync         # Sync local changes to cache (no version bump needed)
cf dev restart      # Reinstall local dev plugin (off + on)
```

## Subcommands

### `cf dev on`

Switches to using a local copy of the plugin:

```bash
# Use current directory as local source
cf dev on

# Or specify a path
cf dev on /path/to/coding-friend
```

This command:
1. Uninstalls the remote plugin (if installed)
2. Removes the remote marketplace
3. Adds the local directory as a marketplace
4. Installs the plugin from the local source
5. Saves the dev state for later restoration

The path must point to the repo root containing `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

### `cf dev off`

Switches back to the remote marketplace:

```bash
cf dev off
```

This command reverses what `cf dev on` did — restores the remote marketplace and reinstalls the plugin from GitHub.

### `cf dev status`

Shows whether dev mode is currently active:

```bash
cf dev status
```

Example output:

```
ℹ Dev mode: ON
ℹ Local path: /Users/you/git/coding-friend
  Since: 2026-02-27T21:32:37.082Z
```

### `cf dev sync`

Copies local source files into the plugin cache without requiring a version bump or off/on cycle:

```bash
cf dev sync
```

Example output:

```
→ Syncing /Users/you/git/coding-friend → ~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../0.0.2
✔ Synced 57178 files. Restart Claude Code to apply changes.
```

#### Why you need this

`cf dev on` installs your plugin into a **versioned cache directory**. Claude Code reads hooks, skills, and agents from that cache — not directly from your source files. So after `cf dev on`, any edits you make to local files are invisible to Claude Code until the cache is updated.

Without `cf dev sync`, the only way to pick up changes is to:
1. Bump the version in `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. Run `cf dev off && cf dev on`
3. Restart Claude Code

That's 10–15 seconds per change and pollutes version history with meaningless intermediate bumps.

`cf dev sync` short-circuits this: it pushes your local files directly into the existing cache entry for the current version. No uninstall, no reinstall, no version bump needed.

#### Recommended dev loop

```bash
# One-time setup
cf dev on /path/to/coding-friend

# Repeat until the feature is done:
# 1. Edit files in local source
# 2. cf dev sync
# 3. Restart Claude Code and test

# When done — bump version once and commit
```

**Note:** Skips `.git`, `node_modules`, `.claude`, and `.coding-friend` during sync.

### `cf dev restart`

Reinstalls the local dev plugin by running `cf dev off` then `cf dev on` in sequence:

```bash
cf dev restart
```

Use this when the install state is broken or out of sync (e.g. after a failed `cf dev off`). It reuses the local path saved in the dev state file — no need to specify it again. If dev mode was already OFF, it skips the off step and just runs `cf dev on`.

## When to Use

- **Plugin development** — editing skills, hooks, agents, or commands and testing them in Claude Code
- **VSCode extension** — the extension doesn't support `--plugin-dir`, so `cf dev` is the recommended way to use a local plugin in the extension UI
- **Testing before release** — verify changes work correctly before pushing to the remote marketplace

## Notes

- Dev state is stored at `~/.coding-friend/dev-state.json`
- Restart Claude Code (or reload VSCode window) after switching to see changes
- For CLI-only sessions, you can also use `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/coding-friend` as a lighter alternative (session-scoped, no install needed)
