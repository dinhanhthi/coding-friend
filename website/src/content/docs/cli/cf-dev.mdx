## Overview

`cf dev` lets you seamlessly switch between the remote marketplace plugin and a local source copy. This is essential when developing or testing changes to the Coding Friend plugin itself.

## Usage

```bash
cf dev on [path]    # Switch to local plugin source
cf dev off          # Switch back to remote marketplace
cf dev status       # Show current dev mode
```

## Subcommands

### `cf dev on`

Switches to using a local copy of the plugin:

```bash
# Use current directory as local source
cf dev on

# Or specify a path
cf dev on /path/to/coding-friend
```

This command:
1. Uninstalls the remote plugin (if installed)
2. Removes the remote marketplace
3. Adds the local directory as a marketplace
4. Installs the plugin from the local source
5. Saves the dev state for later restoration

The path must point to a directory containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

### `cf dev off`

Switches back to the remote marketplace:

```bash
cf dev off
```

This command reverses what `cf dev on` did — restores the remote marketplace and reinstalls the plugin from GitHub.

### `cf dev status`

Shows whether dev mode is currently active:

```bash
cf dev status
```

Example output:

```
ℹ Dev mode: ON
ℹ Local path: /Users/you/git/coding-friend
  Since: 2026-02-27T21:32:37.082Z
```

## When to Use

- **Plugin development** — editing skills, hooks, agents, or commands and testing them in Claude Code
- **VSCode extension** — the extension doesn't support `--plugin-dir`, so `cf dev` is the recommended way to use a local plugin in the extension UI
- **Testing before release** — verify changes work correctly before pushing to the remote marketplace

## Notes

- Dev state is stored at `~/.coding-friend/dev-state.json`
- Restart Claude Code (or reload VSCode window) after switching to see changes
- For CLI-only sessions, you can also use `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/coding-friend` as a lighter alternative (session-scoped, no install needed)
