description: "Setup MCP server for integrating learning docs with other LLM clients."
---

## Overview

`cf mcp` generates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration for your learning documentation. Use this to integrate your docs with other LLM clients like ChatGPT, Claude web, or other AI tools.

## Usage

```bash
cf mcp [path]
```

The default path is `docs/learn/`.

## Output

The command prints a JSON configuration object that you can paste into your MCP client setup. This enables those tools to access and search your learning documentation in real time.

## Example

```bash
# Generate MCP config for docs/learn/
cf mcp

# Generate MCP config for custom directory
cf mcp ./my-docs
```

The output will be a JSON object containing server details, available tools, and connection settings that your MCP client can use.
