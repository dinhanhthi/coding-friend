## Overview

Initialize your workspace with Coding Friend. The command guides you through an interactive setup, creating essential documentation folders and configuring your development environment.

## Usage

```bash
cf init
```

## What It Creates

`cf init` creates the following folder structure:

- `docs/plans/` — Implementation plans and task breakdowns
- `docs/memory/` — Project knowledge and reference docs
- `docs/research/` — Research findings and deep dives
- `docs/learn/` — Learning notes and extracted knowledge

## Non-Git Directories

`cf init` works in any directory, even if it's not a git repository. If you're working outside of git, you can still use Coding Friend for documentation and planning.

## .gitignore Configuration

During setup, you can optionally add Coding Friend folders to your `.gitignore`. This is recommended for private notes and research.

## Global Configuration

For platform-specific setup across multiple projects, use:

```bash
cf init --global
```

This installs Coding Friend configuration into the global config directories of supported platforms (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.).
