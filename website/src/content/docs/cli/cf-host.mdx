## Overview

`cf host` transforms your learning documentation into a searchable, browsable website. Perfect for reviewing notes, sharing knowledge with your team, or integrating docs with other tools.

## Usage

```bash
cf host [path]
```

The default path is `docs/learn/`.

## Features

### Local Server

Docs are served at `localhost:3333` by default.

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

The server automatically detects changes to your markdown files and regenerates affected pages without a full rebuild.

### Full-Text Search

Built-in search powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/). Search across all your documentation instantly.

## Example

```bash
# Serve docs from docs/learn/
cf host

# Serve docs from a custom directory
cf host ./my-learning-docs
```
