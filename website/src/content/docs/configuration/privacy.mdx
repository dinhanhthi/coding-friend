## Overview

Coding Friend includes automatic privacy protection that blocks agent access to sensitive files containing credentials, keys, and environment variables.

## Protected Files

The `privacy-block` hook automatically protects:

- All `.env` files (except `.env.example`)
- `.pem` files (certificates and keys)
- `.key` files (private keys)
- `id_rsa` and other SSH identity files
- `.ssh/` directory contents

These files are never exposed to the agent, even if explicitly requested.

## How It Works

The privacy-block hook runs on every tool use. It scans file paths before they're accessed and blocks any matches automatically.

## Disabling Privacy Block

If you need to disable automatic privacy protection (not recommended), set in `.coding-friend/config.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "privacyBlock": false
  }
}
```

**Warning**: Disabling privacy protection may expose sensitive credentials to the agent. Only disable if you're working in a isolated, non-production environment.

## Best Practices

- Never add `.env` files to version control (use `.env.example` instead)
- Keep SSH keys (`~/.ssh/`) separate from your project directory
- Use `.coding-friend/ignore` for additional sensitive patterns
- Audit your `.gitignore` to ensure credentials aren't tracked
