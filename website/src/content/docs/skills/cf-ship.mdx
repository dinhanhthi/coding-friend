The `/cf-ship` skill automates the final steps of feature delivery: running tests, creating a commit, pushing to remote, and opening a pull request.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-ship [hint]
```

## Workflow

1. **Run Tests** — Verify all tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
2. **Create Commit** — Generate conventional commit with your hint
3. **Push to Remote** — Push branch to origin with `-u` flag
4. **Create PR** — Open pull request with auto-generated title and body
5. **Report** — Show PR URL for review

## Examples

```bash
/cf-ship Add notification system
```

Output:
```
✓ Tests passed (42 passed, 0 failed)
✓ Commit created: feat: add notification system with email and SMS
✓ Pushed to origin/feature/notification-system
✓ PR created: https://github.com/yourorg/repo/pull/42
```

## Requirements

- All changes staged and ready to commit
- All tests passing
- Branch created and has commits
- Remote configured (usually origin)
- GitHub credentials available (gh CLI or GITHUB_TOKEN)

## Pre-Flight Checks

`/cf-ship` verifies:
- Working directory clean (nothing untracked left behind)
- Tests pass before committing
- Branch isn't already on main/master
- Remote is reachable

## PR Details

The generated PR includes:
- Clear title based on your commit
- Summary of changes
- Link to related issues (if detected)
- Test results and coverage
- Reviewers assigned (if configured)

## When to Use

- Ready to ship a completed feature
- Bug fix tested and verified
- Documentation updates finalized
- Any work ready for team review

## Workflow Integration

Pairs perfectly with:
- `/cf-plan` — Design first
- `/cf-fix` — Bug resolution
- `/cf-commit` — Manual staging
