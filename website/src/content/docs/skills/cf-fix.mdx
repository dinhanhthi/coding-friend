description: "Quick bug fix workflow with problem verification."
---

The `/cf-fix` skill streamlines bug fixing by verifying the problem exists, confirming your approach, implementing a fix with tests, and verifying the solution works.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-fix [bug description]
```

## Workflow

1. **Verify Problem** — Reproduce the bug, understand failure conditions
2. **Confirm Approach** — Discuss the fix strategy before implementation
3. **Implement with Tests** — Write failing test first, then fix code
4. **Verify Solution** — Run all tests to confirm fix and no regressions

## Example

```bash
/cf-fix Login fails with 401 error when auth token expires
```

The skill will:
- Reproduce the 401 error with an expired token
- Identify where the auth check happens
- Design token refresh strategy
- Write test for token refresh logic
- Implement the fix
- Run full test suite to verify

## Key Features

- **TDD Integration** — Enforces test-first approach for bug fixes
- **Regression Prevention** — Runs existing tests to catch side effects
- **Minimal Changes** — Focuses on surgical fixes, not rewrites
- **Documentation** — Comments explain why, not just what

## When to Use

- Production bugs affecting users
- Flaky tests that fail intermittently
- Unexpected behavior in existing features
- Performance regressions

## Output

Fixes include:
- Test file demonstrating the bug
- Source code changes with comments
- Git log showing the fix commit
- Test report showing no regressions
