title: "/cf-remember"
description: "Capture project knowledge for AI memory across sessions."
---

The `/cf-remember` skill captures important project knowledge and saves it for future reference. In subsequent sessions, the AI can read and apply this knowledge, accelerating work.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-remember [topic]
```

## What It Does

1. **Captures Context** — Extracts relevant code patterns and decisions
2. **Documents Learning** — Writes clear explanations of how things work
3. **Saves to Memory** — Stores in `docs/memory/` with proper organization
4. **Indexes for Retrieval** — Makes knowledge searchable and linkable
5. **Enables Cross-Session Reference** — Future work uses these docs

## Examples

```bash
/cf-remember auth flow decisions and implementation
```

```bash
/cf-remember database schema and relationships
```

```bash
/cf-remember error handling patterns used across the codebase
```

## Memory Organization

Knowledge is saved to `docs/memory/` with intuitive structure:

```
docs/memory/
  ├── architecture/
  │   ├── system-overview.md
  │   └── microservices-design.md
  ├── patterns/
  │   ├── error-handling.md
  │   ├── middleware-chain.md
  │   └── state-management.md
  ├── decisions/
  │   ├── why-we-chose-postgres.md
  │   ├── api-versioning-strategy.md
  │   └── caching-approach.md
  └── gotchas/
      └── known-issues.md
```

## Document Format

Each document includes:
- What (behavior or design)
- Why (reasoning and trade-offs)
- How (code examples and implementation)
- Related patterns (cross-references)

## When to Use

- After onboarding to understand current patterns
- When completing complex features
- After discovering important design decisions
- When solving challenging problems (for future reference)
- Documenting gotchas and lessons learned

## AI Workflow Benefits

With good memory:
- AI understands project patterns faster
- Decisions get applied consistently
- Onboarding new contributors is faster
- Knowledge doesn't get lost between sessions
