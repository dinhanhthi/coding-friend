The `/cf-plan` skill helps you design solutions before writing code. It explores your codebase, identifies patterns, asks clarifying questions, and produces a detailed implementation plan.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-plan [task description]
```

## What It Does

1. **Codebase Exploration** — Scans relevant files to understand your tech stack and patterns
2. **Clarifying Questions** — Identifies gaps in understanding and asks for requirements
3. **Pattern Analysis** — Discovers existing conventions you should follow
4. **Design Phase** — Creates architecture decisions and trade-off analysis
5. **Plan Generation** — Writes a step-by-step implementation plan to `docs/plans/`

## Example

```bash
/cf-plan Build a REST API with JWT authentication and rate limiting
```

The skill will:
- Review your existing API structure
- Check how auth is currently handled
- Propose endpoint design
- Identify rate limiting libraries
- Create a phased implementation plan
- Save the plan to `docs/plans/rest-api-auth-plan.md`

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature with uncertain scope
- Redesigning a complex system
- Onboarding to unfamiliar codebases
- Planning migrations or refactors

## Output

Plans are saved to `docs/plans/` with the format:
```
docs/plans/
  ├── rest-api-auth-plan.md
  ├── database-migration-plan.md
  └── ...
```

Each plan includes:
- Requirements clarification
- Architecture diagram (ASCII or description)
- Implementation phases
- Risk assessment
- Testing strategy
