description: "Multi-layer code review in a forked subagent."
---

The `/cf-review` skill performs comprehensive code review using a dedicated subagent. It examines code from multiple angles: security, performance, style, and test coverage.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-review [target]
```

## What It Checks

| Dimension | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Security** | SQL injection, auth bypasses, exposed secrets, unsafe deserialization |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms, unnecessary allocations |
| **Style** | Code clarity, naming, consistency with codebase patterns, readability |
| **Maintainability** | Complexity, modularity, test coverage, documentation |
| **Testing** | Edge cases, error paths, integration test gaps |

## Examples

```bash
/cf-review src/auth/
```

```bash
/cf-review src/api/handlers/user-controller.ts
```

```bash
/cf-review db/migrations/
```

## Subagent Isolation

Reviews run in a forked subagent, providing:
- **Fresh Perspective** — Unbiased analysis of your code
- **Parallel Processing** — Doesn't interfere with your main workflow
- **Focused Context** — Subagent concentrates solely on review
- **Detailed Report** — Structured findings with severity levels

## Output

Reviews include:
- Critical security issues with fixes
- Performance bottlenecks with optimization suggestions
- Style improvements aligned with codebase conventions
- Test coverage gaps with test ideas
- Overall quality assessment

## When to Use

- Before merging high-risk changes
- Security-sensitive code (auth, payments, data handling)
- Performance-critical paths
- Public API changes
- Junior developer code for mentorship
