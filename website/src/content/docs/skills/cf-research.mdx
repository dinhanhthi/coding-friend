description: "In-depth research with web search and parallel subagents."
---

The `/cf-research` skill performs thorough technical research using web search and multiple subagents working in parallel. Results are saved to `docs/research/` for future reference.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-research [topic]
```

## What It Does

1. **Breaks Down Topic** — Identifies research questions and angles
2. **Parallel Search** — Multiple subagents search simultaneously
3. **Evaluates Sources** — Filters for relevance and credibility
4. **Synthesizes Findings** — Combines results into coherent document
5. **Saves to Research Dir** — Stores in `docs/research/` for future use

## Examples

```bash
/cf-research best practices for JWT refresh tokens
```

```bash
/cf-research comparing Firebase vs self-hosted auth solutions
```

```bash
/cf-research performance optimization for React applications
```

## Research Coverage

Comprehensive research includes:
- **Official Documentation** — First-party sources from maintainers
- **Best Practices** — Community standards and recommendations
- **Performance Comparisons** — Benchmarks and trade-offs
- **Case Studies** — Real-world implementations and lessons
- **Gotchas** — Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- **Tooling** — Libraries, frameworks, and utilities

## Output Structure

## Parallel Subagents

Research leverages multiple subagents that work simultaneously on:
- Best practice documentation
- Implementation guides
- Security considerations
- Performance benchmarks
- Tool comparisons

Results are merged into a single comprehensive document.

## When to Use

- Choosing new technologies or frameworks
- Deep-diving into complex topics before implementation
- Security-critical decisions (auth, encryption, data handling)
- Performance optimization research
- Evaluating library alternatives
- Understanding emerging best practices

## Output Quality

Research documents include:
- Summary and key takeaways
- Detailed analysis by subtopic
- Relevant code examples
- Comparison tables
- Recommended resources
- Full source citations
