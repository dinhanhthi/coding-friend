The `cf-sys-debug` skill activates when you're debugging issues. It guides you through a structured 4-phase methodology: Observe, Hypothesize, Test, Fix.

## When It Activates

Automatically triggered when:
- Code is failing or behaving unexpectedly
- Tracking down a bug or error
- Investigating performance issues
- Debugging test failures

## The 4-Phase Methodology

### Phase 1: Observe
Gather facts without assumptions. Don't debug in your head.

- Reproduce the bug consistently
- Capture error messages and stack traces
- Note what works and what fails
- Identify patterns (always fails? intermittent?)
- Check logs and monitoring data

Example:
```
Bug: Login endpoint returns 500 error
Facts:
  - Error occurs on POST /api/auth/login
  - Fails with: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'email' of undefined"
  - Works with valid email/password before (regression)
  - Database connection is healthy
  - Error only happens in production, not local
```

### Phase 2: Hypothesize
Based on observations, form a testable hypothesis.

```
Hypothesis: User record was deleted from database
after last successful login, causing null reference.

Alternative: Request payload parsing changed,
dropping email field in recent deploy.
```

### Phase 3: Test
Verify your hypothesis. Design minimal tests.

```bash
# Test hypothesis 1: Check database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

# Test hypothesis 2: Log request payload
console.log('Incoming payload:', req.body);

# Add temporary debugging code
if (!user?.email) {
  console.log('User object:', user);
  throw new Error('DEBUG: user.email is undefined');
}
```

### Phase 4: Fix
Once root cause is confirmed, implement the fix.

- Fix only the root cause, not symptoms
- Keep changes minimal
- Add regression test
- Verify fix doesn't break other things

## Key Principles

- **Collect Data** — Use logs, errors, and tests, not guesses
- **Isolate** — Find the narrowest failing case
- **Reproduce** — Make failure consistent and repeatable
- **Question Assumptions** — Your first guess is often wrong
- **Automate** — Convert manual debugging to automated tests

## Tools to Use

- Browser DevTools for frontend issues
- Server logs and monitoring (CloudWatch, Sentry, etc.)
- Database queries for data verification
- Profilers for performance issues
- Unit tests for edge cases
- Git blame/log to find recent changes
