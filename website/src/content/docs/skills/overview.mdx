---

Coding Friend provides a comprehensive toolkit of 15 skills that automate common engineering workflows. Ten are triggered on-demand via slash commands, while five activate automatically in response to your coding patterns.

## Slash Commands

Interactive skills you trigger directly to solve specific problems.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/cf-plan` | Brainstorm and create structured implementation plans | `/cf-plan Build a REST API with auth` |
| `/cf-fix` | Quick bug fix workflow with problem verification | `/cf-fix Login fails with 401 error` |
| `/cf-ask` | Quick Q&A about your codebase with persistent memory | `/cf-ask How does the auth middleware work?` |
| `/cf-optimize` | Structured optimization with before/after measurement | `/cf-optimize getUserById query` |
| `/cf-review` | Multi-layer code review in a forked subagent | `/cf-review src/auth/` |
| `/cf-commit` | Smart conventional commits with diff analysis | `/cf-commit refactor auth flow` |
| `/cf-ship` | Verify, commit, push, and create PR in one command | `/cf-ship Add notification system` |
| `/cf-remember` | Capture project knowledge for AI memory across sessions | `/cf-remember auth flow decisions` |
| `/cf-learn` | Extract human learning docs from coding sessions | `/cf-learn TypeScript patterns` |
| `/cf-research` | In-depth research with web search and parallel subagents | `/cf-research best practices for JWT tokens` |

## Auto-Invoked Skills

These skills activate automatically based on what you're doing, without needing an explicit command.

| Skill | Activates When | What It Does |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| `cf-tdd` | Writing new code | Enforces test-driven development: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR |
| `cf-sys-debug` | Debugging issues | Guides 4-phase systematic debugging: Observe, Hypothesize, Test, Fix |
| `cf-code-review` | Reviewing code changes | Applies multi-layer review checklist (correctness, security, performance, maintainability, tests) |
| `cf-verification` | Before claiming task complete | Ensures tests pass, changes verified, no regressions introduced |
| `cf-learn` | After substantial new knowledge | Auto-extracts learnings to docs/learn/ for future reference |

## Next Steps

Explore individual skill documentation to learn how each one works and when to use it. Start with `/cf-plan` for designing new features and `/cf-fix` for resolving bugs.
