The `/cf-ask` skill answers questions about your codebase and saves the answers to persistent memory. Future sessions can reference these answers, building institutional knowledge.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-ask [question]
```

## What It Does

1. **Analyzes Codebase** — Examines relevant files to answer your question
2. **Provides Answer** — Gives clear, concise explanation with code examples
3. **Saves to Memory** — Stores Q&A in `docs/memory/` for future reference
4. **Cross-References** — Links to related questions and learnings

## Examples

```bash
/cf-ask How does the auth middleware work?
```

```bash
/cf-ask What database schema does the user model use?
```

```bash
/cf-ask Where are API error codes defined?
```

## When to Use

- Onboarding to a new codebase
- Understanding design decisions
- Locating specific functionality
- Quick clarifications during development

## Memory System

Answers are saved to `docs/memory/` and indexed by topic:

```
docs/memory/
  ├── architecture/
  │   ├── auth-flow.md
  │   └── database-design.md
  ├── patterns/
  │   ├── error-handling.md
  │   └── state-management.md
  └── decisions/
      ├── jwt-vs-sessions.md
      └── database-choice.md
```

## Benefits

- **Reduces Ramp-Up Time** — Captured knowledge speeds onboarding
- **Consistency** — Team references same answers
- **Searchable** — Find answers from previous conversations
- **AI-Readable** — Helps AI understand your codebase faster
