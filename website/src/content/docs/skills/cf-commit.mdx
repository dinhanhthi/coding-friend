The `/cf-commit` skill creates well-formed conventional commits by analyzing your staged changes and generating appropriate commit messages.

## Usage

```bash
/cf-commit [hint]
```

## What It Does

1. **Analyzes Staged Changes** — Reviews diffs of all staged files
2. **Determines Type** — Classifies as feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, or chore
3. **Generates Message** — Creates clear, descriptive commit message
4. **Follows Convention** — Adheres to conventional commits standard
5. **Creates Commit** — Stages all changes and commits with your message

## Commit Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix or error correction |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test` | Test additions or modifications |
| `docs` | Documentation, README, comments |
| `chore` | Dependency updates, build scripts, config |

## Examples

```bash
# Stage your changes, then:
/cf-commit add user authentication
# Creates: feat: add user authentication with JWT tokens
```

```bash
/cf-commit fix sidebar alignment
# Creates: fix: resolve sidebar misalignment on mobile view
```

## Message Format

```
type(scope): description

Body with more context if needed.
Explains the "why" not just the "what".
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency** — Same format across all commits
- **Clarity** — Descriptive messages aid code archaeology
- **Automation** — Conventional format enables automated changelog generation
- **History** — Easy to find related changes with `git log --grep`

## When to Use

- After completing a feature
- Fixing bugs
- Refactoring code sections
- Adding tests or documentation
- Any staged change ready to commit
