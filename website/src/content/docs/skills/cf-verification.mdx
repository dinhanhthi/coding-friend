description: "Verification gate that ensures tests pass before claiming done."
---

The `cf-verification` skill activates before you claim a task is complete. It enforces a verification gate: all tests must pass, changes must be verified working, and no regressions should be introduced.

## When It Activates

Automatically triggered when:
- Completing a feature or bug fix
- Before running `/cf-ship`
- Before marking a task done
- Any time you claim work is finished

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Tests Pass
All automated tests must pass.

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test
# OR
pytest
# OR
your test command here
```

Verifies:
- Unit tests passing
- Integration tests passing
- E2E tests passing (if applicable)
- No flaky or intermittent failures
- No skipped tests masking problems

### 2. Changes Are Verified
Your changes work as expected.

```bash
# Manual verification steps
# For features: test happy path and error cases
# For fixes: reproduce bug was happening, confirm fix resolves it
# For refactors: verify behavior unchanged
```

Examples:
- Feature: test new UI works, handles edge cases
- Bug fix: reproduce original error, confirm it's gone
- Refactor: verify same behavior, performance acceptable

### 3. No Regressions
Existing functionality still works.

- Previously passing tests still pass
- Related features still function
- Performance not degraded
- Database migrations reversible
- Dependent systems compatible

### 4. Code Quality
Meet minimum quality standards.

```bash
# Static analysis and linting
npm run lint
# Type checking
npm run typecheck
# Code coverage
npm run coverage
```

Verifies:
- No linting errors
- Type safety checked
- Test coverage acceptable
- No obvious bugs from analysis
- Consistent with codebase standards

### 5. Documentation Updated
Changes are documented.

- README updated if behavior changed
- Comments added for complex logic
- API docs updated for new endpoints
- Migration guide if database changed
- CHANGELOG entry if user-facing change

## Verification Report
