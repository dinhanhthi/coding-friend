## The Core Workflow

Coding Friend enforces a disciplined engineering workflow. Here's how a typical session looks:

## 1. Plan Your Work

```
/cf-plan Build a user authentication system
```

Coding Friend explores your codebase, identifies existing patterns, and writes a structured implementation plan.

## 2. Write Code with TDD

Simply describe what you want to build. The `cf-tdd` skill activates automatically and enforces:

1. **RED** — Write a failing test first
2. **GREEN** — Write minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR** — Clean up while tests stay green

## 3. Review Your Code

```
/cf-review src/auth/
```

A multi-layer code review runs in a separate subagent, checking security, performance, style, and test coverage.

## 4. Ship It

```
/cf-ship Add user authentication
```

One command to verify all tests pass, create a conventional commit, push, and open a pull request.

## 5. Capture Knowledge

```
/cf-learn
```

Extract what you learned during the session into structured docs. Host them locally with `cf host` or integrate with other LLM clients via `cf mcp`.

## Tips

- Type `/cf-help` to see all available commands
- Skills like `cf-tdd` and `cf-verification` activate automatically — no slash needed
- Use `/cf-ask` for quick questions about your codebase
- Use `/cf-fix` for quick bug fixes with problem verification
