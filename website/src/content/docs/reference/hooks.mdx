## Overview

Hooks are lifecycle functions that execute automatically at specific points in your Coding Friend session. They handle security, formatting, reminders, and context management without requiring manual invocation.

## Hook Reference

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `session-init` | SessionStart | Initialize session state and load configuration |
| `dev-rules-reminder` | UserPromptSubmit | Remind developers of project rules before each prompt |
| `privacy-block` | PreToolUse | Block access to sensitive files (.env, .pem, SSH keys) |
| `scout-block` | PreToolUse | Block access to files matching `.coding-friend/ignore` patterns |
| `statusline` | SessionStart | Configure editor statusline with project info |
| `compact-marker` | PreCompact | Mark files to compact before context summarization |
| `context-tracker` | PostToolUse | Track tool usage and context for performance analysis |

## How Hooks Work

Hooks are executed automatically by the Coding Friend plugin at specific lifecycle events. You don't invoke them manually — they run in the background to support your workflow.

### Controlling Hooks

Enable or disable hooks in `.coding-friend/config.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "privacyBlock": true,
    "scoutBlock": true,
    "devRulesReminder": true,
    "contextTracker": true
  }
}
```

All hooks default to enabled. Set to `false` to disable specific hooks for your project.

## Security Hooks

`privacy-block` and `scout-block` form Coding Friend's first line of defense against accidental credential exposure and inappropriate file access.
